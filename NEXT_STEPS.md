This expanded framework provides a much more comprehensive and varied XCOM-style game experience. You can further improve it by:

1. Implementing a more detailed soldier progression system with skill trees.
2. Adding more varied weapons and equipment options.
3. Creating cinematic cameras for special actions or mission intros/outros.
4. Implementing a dynamic narrative system for campaign progression.
5. Adding sound effects and music to enhance the atmosphere.
6. Implementing a multiplayer mode for PvP battles.
7. Creating a mission editor for user-generated content.

Remember to thoroughly test each new feature, paying special attention to how they interact with each other and the difficulty settings. Regularly playtest the full game loop to ensure a smooth and engaging player experience across different difficulty levels and mission types.
